<h1 align="center">Media Access Function (MAF) API Unity3D package</h1>

## Introduction

This embeded package supports the XR player with **Media Pipelines** implementing the **Media Access Function API (MAF)**.

The MAF library and media pipeline plugins should be compiled by following instructions from [rt-xr-maf-native](https://github.com/5G-MAG/rt-xr-maf-native).


## Package content

rt.xr.maf
  bin/
    - plateform specific builds of the maf library & swig bindings wrapper
    - media pipeline plugins:
      - avpipeline: a simple media pipeline using libav for media fetching, decoding & processing
  maf/
    - C# source code of the swig bindings. While most of the wrapper's C# code is auto-generated by swig and should not be modified manually, this [specific to Unity related issue](https://github.com/swig/swig/pull/1262) required a minor manual modification to `maf/swig/mafPInvoke.cs`.
  dependencies/
    - platform specific builds of shared dependencies, see [dependencies/README.md](./dependencies/README.md)
  Plugins.cs
    - registration of media pipeline plugins
